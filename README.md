# AliBabaCodeChallenge
PhoneBook Api

## To initialize the dataBase use the command below 
<sub> dotnet ef database update -s ..\AliBabaCodeChallenge.WebApi </sub>

###
 Connect to DataBase with windows Authentication (The connection string is already in apsetting.json)
 
 ## There are two base tables (contactsAddressType, contactsPhoneNumberType). These are the types of address and phone number. There are already three records in each of these tables with Ids from 1 to 3. Use these Ids to insert and update Contacts. (These records have been inserted through seed data.)
 ## These two types were meant to be inserted from database entry. If there are more types needed we could use the seed data.
